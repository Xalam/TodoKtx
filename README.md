# Todo List

You can add your to-do list into the app, set the date and time for it so that you will get reminders at the right time. You can check the list as well as complete by marking the list after the task is complete, deleting the task if it is not needed and editing the task. Another option is calendar and you can have an overview of all your tasks in a compact view.
